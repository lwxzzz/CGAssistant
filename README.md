2. Windows SDK 10 (the msvc projects uses Windows SDK version 10.0.17763.0, please redirect to your local version if you have installed a different version of Windows SDK)

3. [QT 5.12+ for msvc2017, win32 (x86), with QtCreator](https://www.qt.io/download)

2. Run "init-dep.bat", wait until all required submodules / dependencies are pulled. (this may takes couple of minutes, depending on your network connection and download speed)

3. Run "build-boost.bat", wait until all boost static libs are generated. (this may takes couple of minutes, depending on your CPU performance)

4. Run "build-CGAHook.bat", wait until "CGAHook.dll" is generated under "build" directory. Remember to redirect the Windows SDK version for msvc project if you have installed a different version of Windows SDK other than "10.0.17763.0".

5. Run "build-qhttp.bat", wait until "qhttp.dll" generated under "build" directory.

6. Run "build-CGAssiatant.bat", wait until "CGAssistant.exe" generated under "build" directory.

7. Run "build-nodegyp.bat", wait until "node_cga.node" generated under "build/Release" directory.

8. Run "windeploy.bat"

Now you have all compiled binaries copied into "build" directory if no error occured.
